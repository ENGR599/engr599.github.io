# ENGR 399/599 "Hardware Security" Syllabus

Revision: F2025.1

## Description

This course provides a broad, comprehensive, and practical overview of hardware
security with the goal of helping students understand the role of how hardware
and hardware/software interaction impact the overall system security.  This
course gives an overview of known attack methodologies and countermeasures for a
variety of computer hardware. It will teach how to identify key hardware
security issues and develop effective countermeasures at each level of hardware
abstraction.  

Having completed this course, you will have experience with the following: 
 * Knowledge of the state-of-the-art security methods and devices; 
 * Integration of security as a design metric, not as an afterthought; 
 * Protection of the design intellectual property against piracy and tampering; 
 * Better understanding of hardware security attacks and providing countermeasures against them; 
 * Detection and isolation of hardware Trojans; 
 * Knowledge of how to detect and prevent counterfeit electronics

<!-- ## Projects

Over the course of the semester, we will assign multiple programming projects.
Full points will requires these projects be submitted to the autograder and/or be
demonstrated to the course staff. 
-->

## Due Dates and Extensions

**Assignments turned in after the exact time and date specified on the
assignment will receive a zero**. We do not generally offer extensions. For
example, we do not offer extensions due to crowded computing sites, slow
computers, internet access problems,
accidental erasure or loss of files, or outside conflicting commitments.

We will consider extension requests made in person and at least two weeks in
advance, for example, for religious holidays or planned medical procedures.
Additionally, we will consider requests for extensions due to documented,
unanticipated medical or personal emergencies. If you can't see the instructor
in advance due to the emergency, then contact them as soon as you possibly can.
In all cases, we require written proof of the emergency.

## Grading

Your final grade is based on scores from exams, the programming projects, and
the final design challenge. The tentative point distribution is included in the
following table. It is not likely that this will change, but circumstances might
occur which would make changes necessary, at the discretion of the instructor.
*Once a grade has been posted to Canvas, you will have one week to appeal the
grade.*

| Exams    | Projects  | Participation |
| -------- |  ---      | --            |
|    40%   |  50%      | 10%           |


## Academic Integrity

Learning difficult or complicated material is often facilitated by discussions
between students and we encourage you to form study groups to try to solve
difficult problems together.

However, **exams and programming projects must be your own work**. Do not cheat
in any way: do your own work! Doing your own work means that you must turn in
your own, original work. It means you do not turn in a solution copied from
somebody else or found on the web. In programming projects, working together may
extend to figuring out overall strategies for solution but **you may not work
together or share the actual code** that you submit.

## Disability Services for Students

If you think you need an accommodation for a disability, please let your
instructor know during the first three weeks of the semester. Some aspects of
this course may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As
soon as you make us aware of your needs, we can work with the Office of
Disability Services for Students (DSS) help us determine appropriate academic
accommodations. Any information you provide is private and confidential and will
be treated as such.

## Corrections and Clarifications

We will post a Canvas announcement in the case of any critical corrections or
clarifications. It is your responsibility to ensure you are able to receive
Canvas announcements.
